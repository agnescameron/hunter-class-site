> *While the language of vision perseveres, it is important not to assume a direct correlation between vision as a sense and visualization as an object and practice. Married initially to psychology, and now digital computation and algorithmic logic, the substrate and content of this practice has often had little to do with human sense perception or the optic system. Moreover, with the rise of emphasis on haptic interactions and interactivity, visualizations also often take multisensorial modes. Vision cannot be taken, therefore, as an isolated form of perception, but rather must be understood as inseparable from other senses.*
