- What *communities* do you belong to? What kind of user would they be?

- What would a website just for *you* look like?

- Why do websites all look the *same*?

- What's the difference between a *person*, a *citizen*, a *consumer* and a *user*?

- What is the purpose of *efficiency*?

- What is an [*affordance*](https://www.interaction-design.org/literature/topics/affordances)?

- Where is the *production* and *exchange* of *value* happening on this platform?

- What are the uses of *smoothness* and *friction*?

- What makes a website feel *alive*?

- What kind of *behaviours* are encouraged or discouraged?

- Where was the last place on the web that *surprised* you?

- Are you *enjoying* it?

- Does the *form* relate to the *content*?
