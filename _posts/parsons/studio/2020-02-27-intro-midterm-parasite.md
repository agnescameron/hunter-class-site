Midterm assignment: Parasites

Over the next two weeks, you will learn the basics of JQuery selectors, javascript functions and json objects. This will give you the rudimentary tools to select and manipulate elements on a webpage, as well as to store and transform data in the form of objects.

For this midterm, we ask you to be a parasite. A parasite is a creature that "eats alongside", who hijacks the functions of a host organism and reappropriates them for a different purpose. 

Choose a website and analyse its affordance, functions and context. In what ways does its aesthetic, functional and socio-cultural embodiment give meaning to its content or experience?

Using a combination of JQuery, JS functions and Json objects, subvert the purpose of this website to create a different narrative and experience. 

This could be:
 
 Making a small, safe haven in an otherwise adversarial or forbidding website (e.g. a U.S. immigration page). 

 Taking a website designed for advertisement and propaganda and revealing its deceptions, or using them to sell your own product.

 Using one of the short stories we have read as your new narrative material, and using the navigation of an existing website to reimagine the story. Kafka, perhaps?
