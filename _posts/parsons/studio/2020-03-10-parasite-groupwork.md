**First Remote Class plan**

- **Discussion of readings** (40min)
	- Worlding; what makes a world?
		- Spatial and temporal structuring.
		- Embodiment and situation: how does the user relate to this structure?
		- What knowledge is created about the world (/what kind of world is this?)
	- Hypertexts
		- Everything is a "text"; it's just a question of how you put them together.
			- e.g. 
				- Appropriation, collection, curation (e.g. "Carrier Bag")
					- The user's identity is part of this process.
				- "Hijacking" (e.g. nCage)
				- Portals and connections (e.g "The Tower of Babylon")
				- "Remaking your space", taking power away from the architect
	- Information and infinity (Borges)
		- Proposition: culture and knowledge is about making new patterns + forms, not new content.
<br/><br/>
- **Prototyping** (1hr 30min total)
	- Discuss (30min)
		- Our affordances… Recap of skills we have learned!
		- Make a list of what we can do to the web.
			- Cross-ref with Agnes' list
		- Look at some examples of extension projects.
			- Remember: Concept and context are important for this one. What do you want to do to your host? 
				- Could think of a verb: Break-down? Re-imagine? Reveal? Reflect? Subvert? 
			- [**Bylines**](https://www.are.na/kira-simon-kennedy/bylines)
				- [Code](https://github.com/melaniehoff/bylines/blob/master/manifest.json)
			- [TrackMeNot](http://trackmenot.io/)
			- **nCage**
			- [Textbook](https://bengrosser.com/projects/textbook/)
			- [Make Trump's Tweets Eight Again](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/make-trump-tweets-eight-again/?src=search)
			- [Clippy](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/clippy-the-paperclip-assi/fmbcdhjmhddnnpeomknikdbboejbhdcl?hl=en-US)
			- [**Jailbreak the Patriarchy**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/jailbreak-the-patriarchy/fiidcfoaaciclafodoficaofidfencgd?hl=en-US)
		- Understand the workflow
			- Concept => Paper Prototype => Wireframe =>  
			- (=> means user test! feedback! Iterate!)
	- Breakout Groups (40min)
		- Jacey, Joy, Tia
Rachael, Erin, Elias
		- Avni, Xianyu, Jonna
		- Claire, Lily, Sophia
		- Siran, Evanna, Vivian
			- Discuss your ideas together: what will you do with your host site?
			- Look at **one** of your host sites together. Break it down and **write down** the important structural components and how you want to manipulate them. If there's time, work out code methods together. (Gary will visit each group).
				- e.g. *All these banner ads have the class name "header-image" under the div with id "banner", you could use JQuery to manipulate those with <code>$('#banner .header-image').css({ … })</code>.*
				<br/><br/>
	- **Presentations** (20min)
		- 4min each, present:
			- Your host sites and your main idea.
			- An overview of your detailed breakdown of one host site and what you found.
