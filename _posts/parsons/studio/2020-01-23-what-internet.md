### web archaeology using the [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org)

* how did it change over time?
* what kind of changes in technology/culture do these reflect?
* how do you think the intentions of the design evolved - were they effective?
* how did the changes affect your interactions, perceptions, and the online landscape?

### lecture: what is the internet? 

**it's part of a long history that connects communication, war and the planet**<br>
[Ancient Greek fire signals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smoke_signal) and [Agamemnon](https://chs.harvard.edu/CHS/article/displayPdf/2871) (330BC)<br>

**the internet is just other computers**<br>
[the server-client model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Client%E2%80%93server_model#/media/File:Client-server-model.svg)<br>

**but increasingly, some of those computers are really, really big**<br>
[much of what we access is hosted on server farms like Google's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=avP5d16wEp0&feature=emb_title)<br>

**beginning in the Cold War, decentralization means resilience**<br>

> “While many have debated the origins of the Internet, it’s clear that in many ways it was built to withstand nuclear attack. The Net was designed as a solution to the vulnerability of the military’s centralized system of command and control during the late 1950’s and beyond. For, the argument goes, if there are no central command centers, then there can be no central targets and overall damage is reduced.” Alex Galloway, *Protocol*, 2001

**while decentralized transport networks have many ways to get from A to B**<br>

**and yet the internet can be very fragile**<br>

> The myth persists that the Net was built to withstand the blast of an atomic bomb. But that was the military-run Arpanet of the 1970s, not the corporate-run Internet of today. “What’s basically wrong is we are centralized,” explains Dr. Peter Salus, Internet historian and author of Casting the Net. “We have violated the constraints that the Department of Defense had in 1967.” [*Wired* in 1997](https://www.wired.com/1997/08/50-ways-to-crash-the-net/)
