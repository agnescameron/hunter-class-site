### web archaeology using the [Wayback Machine](http://web.archive.org)

* how did it change over time?
* what kind of changes in technology/culture do these reflect?
* how do you think the intentions of the design evolved - were they effective?

### lecture: what is the internet? 

**it's part of a long history that connects communication, war and the planet**<br>

> The myth persists that the Net was built to withstand the blast of an atomic bomb. But that was the military-run Arpanet of the 1970s, not the corporate-run Internet of today. “What’s basically wrong is we are centralized,” explains Dr. Peter Salus, Internet historian and author of Casting the Net. “We have violated the constraints that the Department of Defense had in 1967.” [*Wired* in 1997](https://www.wired.com/1997/08/50-ways-to-crash-the-net/)
