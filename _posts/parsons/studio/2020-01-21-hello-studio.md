<!-- middlebrow design will be done by algorithms by the time you are 30. good design, then, is not about making "nice websites". design has traditionally been about visual intelligence, centered on organization of the printed word, cf. Benjamin Franklin. today to be a designer means to understand the complex systems of communication by which our world is mediated, to embrace its messiness and to organise it in meaningful configurations. in that sense there is perhaps no more important discipline than communication design. -->
