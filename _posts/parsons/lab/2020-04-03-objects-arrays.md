> *The class name of an object creates a vocabulary for discussing a design. Indeed, many people have remarked that object design has more in common with language design than with procedural program design. We urge learners (and spend considerable time ourselves while designing) to find just the right set of words to describe our objects, a set that is internally consistent and evocative in the context of the larger design environment.*

## notes: object orientations

Hi friends, excited for this new format. Here are some notes!

Let's recap first what we've learned about Javascript so far:

* we can use Javascript to modify the Document Object Model, an ordered representation of HTML and CSS that your browser creates when it renders a page
* Javascript code is often written in terms of re-usable blocks of code called *functions*
* functions take in input in terms of *variables*, and produce an output based on what the code inside them does

(we learned some other stuff too, but these is the important bits for now)

This class is about arrays, and about Javascript Object Notation (JSON). These are ways of storing and transmitting information that are central to the Javascript language (arrays exist in other languages, but JSON is a JavaScript thing).

If any of the sections below are unclear (or you'd rather see some different examples), I've linked the corresponding W3Schools notes in each title. 

To play along with these examples, open up a web browser and paste them into the console!

### [Variables](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_variables.asp)
A variable is like an 'empty box' used to store a piece of information. We've encountered these already in functions: in the function below, topping1 and topping2 are both variables created by the function to store the pizza toppings the function gets called with.

```
function makePizza(topping1, topping2) {
	console.log("hi yeah yeah I'd like to order a large pizza with ", topping1, topping2)
}
```

When we call the function `makePizza`, we *pass* those variables to the function using the round brackets.

```
makePizza("anchovies", "parsons school of design")
```

Will cause the line below to print to the command line:

```
hi yeah yeah I'd like to order a large pizza with anchovies and yeah also some parsons school of design
```

Variables can also exist outside of functions. In order to make them exist, we need to *declare* them, which we do with the keyword `var`. `var` is a heads-up to the browser that a variable is coming, and it means we can store values in our code without having to type them out in full each time.

The code below will do the same thing as calling the function we had before:

```
var topping1 = "anchovies"
var topping2 = "parsons school of design"
console.log("hi yeah yeah I'd like to order a large pizza with", topping1, topping2)
```

The variable `topping1` *stores* the value `"anchovies"`, and the variable `topping2` stores `"parsons school of design"`. Until you tell the browser otherwise, those are the values those variables will contain!

### Arrays
Arrays give us a way of storing multiple values inside a single variable. Neat! (is it? turns out: yes)

One nice thing about being able to store multiple values is that, if you have a group of related variables, you can move them around together rather than storing each one in a separate variable. This gets useful when we want to handle a lot of things at once. Consider our earlier function. What if, instead of two toppings, we had 5?

To write these as an array, we still use `var`, but to collect all the values together we wrap them in square brackets, separated by commas:

```
var toppings = ["anchovies", "parsons school of design", "parsley", "cheese", "pencils"]
```

Now, if we want to use the array in our code, we could try:

```
console.log("hi yeah yeah I'd like to order a large pizza with ", toppings)
```

This prints:

```
hi yeah yeah I'd like to order a large pizza with (5)Â ["anchovies", "parsons school of design", "parsley", "cheese", "pencils"]
```

This is... OK, but not quite what we want. Ideally, we'd like to get each separate array *element*, then use it in our code. Luckily, arrays have a way to do this called the array *index*. The index is just the number of that element in the array. Indexes count up from 0: so, anchovies is at position 0, and pencils is at position 4. *not 5!!*

To select an element from an array, use the name of the array (in this case, `toppings`), followed by a square bracket containing the index of the element that we want. So: `toppings[0]` is `"anchovies"`, and `toppings[3]` is `"cheese"`.

To use this in our code:

```
console.log("hi yeah yeah I'd like to order a large pizza with", toppings[0], toppings[1], toppings[2], toppings[3], toppings[4])
```

### Iteration

This is nice, but what if the array of toppings had a different number of elements each time? Let's find out. Another person is ordering a pizza, and *their* toppings array is as follows:

```
var toppings = ["spaghetti", "cornflakes", "cheese", "melon", "Abba", "chicken"]
console.log("hi yeah yeah I'd like to order a large pizza with", toppings[0], toppings[1], toppings[2], toppings[3], toppings[4])
```

This will print:

```
hi yeah yeah I'd lile to order a large pizza with spaghetti, cornflakes, cheese, melon, Abba
```

Chicken is at `toppings[5]`, so never gets printed! What happens if we have a shorter array than we're expecting?

```
var toppings = ["honey", "scrambled eggs"]
console.log("hi yeah yeah I'd like to order a large pizza with", toppings[0], toppings[1], toppings[2], toppings[3], toppings[4])
```

We get:

```
hi yeah yeah I'd like to order a large pizza with honey scrambled eggs undefined undefined undefined
```

Oof! Oh no! Now the last 3 elements of our array have *not been defined*, our browser freaks out and doesn't know what to do. This is a really common problem in Javascript: we want to do something to some things (here, print them one by one), but we can't be sure what the things are, or how many we have. Variables take care of the first part, as they allow us to use *different* values in the same code. But: how do we account for different numbers of things? The answer is *iterators*.

Iterators are made for doing things to groups of objects, or for performing some action an indeterminate number of times. They are pretty simple, but they are what allow us to do some pretty complex things. Alongside functions, iterators are a really important building block in writing Javascript.

If we want to iterate over our array `toppings`, we can use a [`forEach`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/forEach) method:

```
var toppings = ["spaghetti", "cornflakes", "cheese", "melon", "Abba", "chicken"]

console.log("hi yeah yeah I'd like to order a large pizza with")
toppings.forEach(function(element) {
		console.log(element)
	})
```

This follows a similar pattern to our jQuery `click` function from last week. It uses an *anonymous function*, inline, that takes in the variable *element*. For each element in the array `toppings`, it will run this code on that element. This prints to the console:

```
hi yeah yeah I'd like to order a large pizza with
spaghetti
cornflakes
cheese
melon
Abba
chicken
```

This is pretty nice. But -- what if we wanted to add them all to one line? Well: we could use a variable to store them! In Javascript, *strings* (things made of letters, wrapped in quotation marks) can be added together in a process called *concatenation*. We can *concatenate* our list together to make one long sentence. It works like this:

```
var word1 = "banana"
var word2 = "split"
var word3 = word1+word2
console.log(word1, word2, word3)
```
will print: `banana split bananasplit`

We can also add strings together into the same variable, using the `+=` symbol. This says: take what's there, and add this thing onto it.

```
var word1 = "banana"
word1 += "split"
console.log(word1)
```
will print: `bananasplit`

To use this in our iterator, we're going to create a variable called `order`, which will hold our sentence.

```
var toppings = ["spaghetti", "cornflakes", "cheese", "melon", "Abba", "chicken"]
var order = "hi yeah yeah I'd like to order a large pizza with "

toppings.forEach(function(element) {
		order += element + ", "
	})

console.log(order)
```

This gives us a stray comma at the end, but that's something we can worry about in later weeks...

```
hi yeah yeah I'd like to order a large pizza with spaghetti, cornflakes, cheese, melon, Abba, chicken, 
```

### Objects
Arrays are pretty cool, and honestly do a lot of useful work in Javascript. However, when it comes to *structured data* -- collections of things that exist in a hierarchical manner -- then we want to use something a bit more ordered. The way we do this is using Javascript Object Notation [(JSON)](https://www.json.org/json-en.html). An object you have *all met already* is the DOM, or the Document Object Model. This stores a representation of the page as a set of structured relations: each part of the page has particular properties, which in turn have their own sub-properties.

We're going to think about objects as *representations of things in terms of their properties*. To explain how objects work, we're going to think about fruit. If you were trying to explain how to tell the difference between different fruits, you might refer to the color, flavor and shape of the fruit. For example:

> "A banana is yellow, sweet and curved, whereas a blueberry is blue, tart and round"

To represent this information in JSON, we can do the following:

```
var blueberry = {
	color: "blue",
	flavor: "tart",
	shape: "round"
}

var banana = {
	color: "yellow",
	flavor: "sweet",
	shape: "curved"
}
```

Now, when we want to know the properties of a fruit, we can get them using *dot notation*. This is something you've encountered before when you were getting parts of the DOM, and it works no different here.

```
console.log(banana.color)
```

prints `yellow`. Try getting the flavor of the blueberry!

We can use these properties in our functions. For example, let's make a function called `describeFruit()`:

```
function describeFruit(fruit) {
	console.log("this fruit is", fruit.color, "and tastes", fruit.flavor)
}
```

If we call the function:

```
describeFruit(banana)
```
Prints: `this fruit is yellow and tastes sweet`


That's it for now! Have a play with this code and see you all in class.
