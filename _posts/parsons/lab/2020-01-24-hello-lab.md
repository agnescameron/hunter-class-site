> *My favorite aspect of websites is their duality: they’re both subject and object at once. In other words, a website creator becomes both author and architect simultaneously. There are endless possibilities as to what a website could be. What kind of room is a website? Or is a website more like a house? A boat? A cloud? A garden? A puddle? Whatever it is, there’s potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity.*

### Tutorial: {{page.tutorial}}

### in-class exercise  
In pairs, use github pages or netlify to publish a minimal site. Once you both have sites up and running, start to add some content either on your own, or together.

### assignment
Step 1:  
use are.na to find a personal homepage* that you’ve not seen before, and that you find interesting. write a short (100-200 word) response:
 
 — what role does this website perform (or try to perform)?
 — how does this website make you feel
 — what does this website tell you about this person?
 — why did you pick this site?

\*a personal homepage is a website dedicated to and managed by a single person, rather than a group, or a company. It should be a page that could conceivably be made by them (e.g. not a celebrity). The homepage shouldn’t be by someone you already know!

Step 2:  
After reading Laurel’s piece, and having set up your GitHub pages site in class, come to the next class having thought about your personal site for this semester. This site will be where you record all of your work, including assignments, reading responses and notes. 
Think about:

 — what requirements does your site need to satisfy?
 — what ideas would you like it to get across?

If you’re feeling confident, you could try and implement your ideas on the GitHub Pages site we set up in class — if not, just add some text, and some sketches to your GitHub folder, and we’ll talk about them at the start of next class.
