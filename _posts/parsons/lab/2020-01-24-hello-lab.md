> *My favorite aspect of websites is their duality: theyâ€™re both subject and object at once. In other words, a website creator becomes both author and architect simultaneously. There are endless possibilities as to what a website could be. What kind of room is a website? Or is a website more like a house? A boat? A cloud? A garden? A puddle? Whatever it is, thereâ€™s potential for a self-reflexive feedback loop: when you put energy into a website, in turn the website helps form your own identity.*
