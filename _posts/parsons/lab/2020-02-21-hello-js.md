### lecture: i n t e r a c t i v i t y
Today we'll explore ways to make your webpage interactive -- something that responds to user input. Many of you already might have tried this in your metaphor class -- which, for some of you, really tested the limits of CSS.

**interactive CSS notes**
We're not going to spend ages on this, as this is a class about Javascript. However, there are some built-in CSS interactions that can be pretty useful for very basic kinds of interactivity. A lot of these use something called CSS ['pseudo-classes']https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Pseudo-classes), which are used to specify special *states* of elements. The favourites of these are:

* [`:hover`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover)
* [`:focus`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus)
* [`:active`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:active)

Think of these as a kind of selector (indeed, pseudo-classes like `:first-child` and `:root` operate much more like these), but one that's also aware of the state of the page.

**JS principles**  
Javascript is the programming language of the web. It is the *only* programming language that natively runs in the browser, and until a while back that was all it did. (These days it's possible to run Javascript outside of a browser too, and we'll do a bit of that later in the semester.)

What is a programming language? Up until now, we've been dealing with HTML and CSS: these, while allowing us to change our webpages, are not technically programming languages, but markup and styling languages. While CSS pseudo-classes offer a limited kind of programmability, that's not what CSS is made for: what we *want*, to make interactive, dynamic websites, is Javascript.

Programming languages are sets of ordered instructions that tell the computer to *do* something, normally based on something else. Javascript is what's called an *interpreted* language -- when your browswer runs Javascript, it just reads it line by line, and completes the steps in order. This is different to some other kinds of computer language, which need to be translated into a different form before they can be used. 

**events**  
The first way a lot of people encounter Javascript is dealing with events in webpages. These are often actually properties of the HTML, but we can set up some Javascript to 'react' when an event occurs. One of the most common of these is the 'onclick' event:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1>wow, clicking button?</h1>

<button type="button" onclick="console.log('heeeeeeeeeeeyyyyy')">
	im gonna click it
</button>

</body>
</html>
```

So -- we've got this `onclick` part: that's a property, which we're familiar with. It belongs to the HTML element. The next part might be a bit less familiar: `console.log('heeeeeeeeeeeyyyyy')`. The 'console' part here is the thing we've been using to look at our code in the browser. It's *also* what we're able to use to see what's going on with Javascript. What other parts are there? The '.' in the middle is a pretty common idea in Javascript, and we'll use it a lot. It means 'this thing on the left, before me -- it has a property (that thing on the right) that I want to access'. In this instance, we're accessing the property -- this *method* --  'log' of the console. This is a cool property! Whatever we put in the brackets after the 'log', it'll print them out (or *log* them) to the console.

so -- give it a click! take a look at the console!


**Javascript, all by itself (almost)**  
That's all very well and good, but it's not actually much room for our Javascript. No worries, as we'll 

When you include a Javascript file in your HTML page, your browser reads it in and immediately starts to follow any instructions you've left lying around in it. This takes a minute to get used to, but is normally pretty useful.


**a very brief look at functions**  
Functions are one of the building blocks of all kinds of programming languages, and essentially they're a neat way of storing some code that we want to use and saving it for later. Some functions, like `console.log()` are just built into browsers. We can run them anytime, and the job they do is always the same.

Some we're allowed to write ourselves. 

in the HTML:
```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="main.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

<h1>wow, clicking button?</h1>

<button type="button" onclick="printWord('heeeeyyyyy')">
	im gonna click it
</button>

</body>
</html>
```



What advantage does this give us?? Aren't we just doing the same thing, but way more complex?

(yes, this is true: but this added structure is going to help us a lot in a couple of minutes)

**talking to the DOM**  
Of course, we can't expect visitors to our websites to open up the web console every time they want to see what's going on on the page. (that said, a lot of websites put stuff in the console so people who know what's up on the web can see secret messages. Examples include [The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/uk), [Harvard Business Review](https://hbr.org), and bits of [jodi.org](http://wwwwwwwww.jodi.org)).

Instead, we need to talk to the DOM -- the Document Object Model. We've been thinking about the DOM for a while now, when we wanted to select things using CSS. We use a similar idea when we write Javascript that changes things on webpages, though we write it a bit differently.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<body>

<h1 id="heading">wow, clicking button?</h1>

<button type="button" onclick="document.getElementById('heading')">im gonna click it</button>

</body>
</html>
```


Some things to note, before we go any further:
* Javascript is *case sensitive*: you can't type in document.getElementByID or Document.getElementById and expect to get anywhere.
* We need to now be careful to use quotation marks for pieces of information like id and class names. This is because of
