description: this class introduces some of the themes we'll be exploring in the final project, looking at self-organising systems, agent-based modelling and cellular automata as ways of exploring complex systems and dynamics.

For the rest of this class, we're going to be thinking about what it means to *simulate*: specifically, what it might mean to simulate on the web. In particular, we will be thinking about how different kinds of simulations can tell different stories, and how we can make complexity and chaos out of very simple code.

Right now, the whole world is watching simulation models: models of predicted spread, of mortality rates, of the effects of different kinds of social isolation. These models are all attempts at understanding an impossibly complex system: how Coronavirus spreads through a population, and what effects it has. Simulation models are wildly influential: in the case of the UK, the fate of an entire country was changed by the release of a single research paper, a model that analysed the government's strategy and calculated a death toll of hundreds of thousands.

Simulations tell us things about our world that, without them, would be far too complex to percieve. We aren't used to thinking in terms of global systems, and simulations give us a way to achieve that. The readings this week give two perspective on the power of computers and video games as simulation tools: 

The goals of this project are your own to set, and depend on what *you* think you might want to learn about. The next 3 classes will introduce different ideas about and philosophies of simulation and environments.

### in-class assignment
Use Nicky Case's [*Simulating*](https://ncase.me/sim/) to make a cellular automaton model of some system that you relate to or experience.

1. Check out an existing simulation model in your groups. Try changing the parameters over screenshare to get some different results. Document your results as you go with notes and screenshots.

2. Add in a new variable: how does this change the system?

3. Together, decide on a system to simulate. 

### assignment
Code your own version of the game of life using Javascript and HTML5 Canvas (or, if you feel comfortable, you can choose a different display).
