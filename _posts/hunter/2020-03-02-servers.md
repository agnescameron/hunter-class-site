### in class assignment
Everyone make a minimal node server, with an endpoint that serves a message. Add your computer's IP address to the board, then query other peoples' endpoints. Can you make a message that changes when other people see it?

### assignment:

'Information' here is pretty broad, but it should be something that changes over time. Maybe it's something happening on the keyboard, a button you're clicking, or how many tabs you have open in google right now...
