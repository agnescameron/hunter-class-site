permalink: /class10/  
tags: [diagrams, systems, simulation]
assignment: play a couple of games and write about them. start planning your simulated environment for your final project.
description: We review the CLI projects [(with pizza??)](/class7/#assignment), and introduce the final project. The lecture will look at games and simulations as tools for critique, political statements, and modes of artistic enquiry. We think about interface metaphors and feedback systems, and talk about some of the history of cybernetics.

### review: CLI projects


### final project
Create a simulated environment or system that exists on the web.
This environment might be a model of a real place, or contain a new kind of creature. It could be a game, or maybe it simply plays itself. Perhaps it is used to explore a system that you're interested in, or critique one that you disagree with. The requirements for this piece are that it:
* is in some way interactive, modifiable or explorable
* should change over time
