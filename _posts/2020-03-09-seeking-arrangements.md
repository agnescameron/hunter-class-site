> *The class name of an object creates a vocabulary for discussing a design. Indeed, many people have remarked that object design has more in common with language design than with procedural program design. We urge learners (and spend considerable time ourselves while designing) to find just the right set of words to describe our objects, a set that is internally consistent and evocative in the context of the larger design environment.*

### in class  
We consider a number of different artworks, and think of ways we might represent them as 'objects'. Are there patterns? Can we put them on axes? What links exist between different ideas in the objects? How do we represent that?

### assignment  
*due {{page.assignment-due}}*<br>
{{page.assignment}}

Your curated (scraped/embellished) dataset should be composed of objects with properties (e.g. not just a list of single words), formatted as a .JSON file. Think about how you might sort the data, using:

* using different modes of classification
* links between different groups of objects

The sorting part you can do either as a webpage, or just using the command line. Don't worry about making it look pretty yet! We'll be using this dataset as the basis for next week's assignment, so make sure it's something you can have a few different perspectives on.
