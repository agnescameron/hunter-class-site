finding things

### in class
in class, find a way to arrange pre existing set? some kind of political compass?

### assignment
find a data set that interests you, and use JQuery to arrange and display it on a webpage
this is an assignment that's mostly for you to experiment because it's only one week: focus on playing around with the data, practising your skills and getting familiar with lots of different approaches rather than making a polished 'thing'.
