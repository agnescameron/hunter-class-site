### in class  
Use the Tarot data set and find some different ways to arrange it.
  
### assignment  
Find a data set that interests you, and use JQuery to arrange and display it on a webpage. This is an assignment that's mostly for you to experiment because it's only one week: focus on playing around with the data, practising your skills and getting familiar with lots of different approaches rather than making a polished 'thing'. Think about:

* using different modes of classification
* links between different groups of objects

If you'd like to use the Tarot set we looked at in class, feel free -- though you need to do a bit more exploration with it!
