### in class  
Use the Tarot data set and find some different ways to arrange it.
  
### assignment  
*due {{page.assignment-due}}*<br>
{{page.assignment}}

Choose (or make!\*) a dataset composed of objects with properties (e.g. not just a list of single words). Use JQuery to experiment with different ways of displaying it on a webpage. As there's only a week for this, focus on playing around with the data, practising your skills and getting familiar with lots of different approaches rather than making a polished 'thing'. Think about:

* using different modes of classification
* links between different groups of objects

If you'd like to use the Tarot set we looked at in class, feel free -- though you need to do a bit more exploration with it!

\* making will add extra time, and is not really the point of this week, but if you're excited about scraping, or adding to an existing data set then by all means do! Similarly, if you're feeling like your data set needs a little fleshing out, adding in scores, or other forms of key might give you some more tools to play with.
