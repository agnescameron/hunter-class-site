what is web programming?
------------------------

If a computer is a tool for thinking with, then the web is a place to
share your thoughts with others. In this class we'll think about web
programming as a tool of representation, speculation, and communication. 
We'll also think about our computers, and use them to have new kinds of thoughts.

This class seeks to give a broad, nuanced and critical understanding of
what it means to make work for the web today. It is structured around a
series of open-ended projects that inform different approaches towards
web programming, and programming more generally, and together will
stretch and challenge your existing skills. These projects are
contextualised by readings and lectures that give a theoretical and
technical basis to the material covered, and discussed in class during
structured critiques.

In order to take this class, you must have already taken Web Production
II and Creative Code (MEDP 234 and 331), and be comfortable programming
in Javascript, HTML, and CSS.

class goals
-----------

-   develop fluency in Javascript and JQuery, and have an understanding of
    common web development workflows
-   understand how the web is structured, and use this to realise more
    complex projects
-   become familiar with the command line and the console
-   understand how and where to include libraries and modules in your
    code
-   through readings and exercises, develop and realise your own ideas
    about what the web should look like
-   learn about simulation techniques, and how they can be used to model
    complex systems
-   be aware of the history and politics of the web, and how this is
    changing

structure of the course
-----------------------

This course is entirely project-based. this means no exams -- but also
this does mean that almost all of your grade is dependent on consistent,
imaginative and thoughtful work on the weekly assignments. Considered
together, these will give you a broad portfolio that demonstrates a
range of skills and techniques. The assignments for this course consist
of six 1-week assignments, two 2-week assignments, and a final project.
Each of these will address a different form and set of ideas, though
there are links between all of them, and you are welcome to use these to
explore one continual theme.

This class is not about having perfect code each week, and I would not
expect you to. Publish and document whatever you have as you go along,
so I can see your thoughts evolving as you go. That said, consistently
incomplete, poor-quality or overly-simple solutions will definitely
affect your grade. If you're struggling, email me before saturday night
at the latest, and turn up to office hours on Monday / make alternative
arrangements, and we can work on getting you back on track. Don't leave
everything till the night before!

Each week, I expect you to write a short paragraph or two (100-250
words) on what you struggled with, what you enjoyed, your thoughts on
the readings and notes for yourself, as part of an ongoing 'blog' on
your site. This will be valuable to you as you revisit your work, and
try and remember what you did and how you did it.

I want you to make this class useful to you, so feel free to adapt
assignments to suit your interests (though talk to me about it first).
These tasks are deliberately open ended, but if you're struggling for
inspiration you are more than welcome to use one of the example problems
that I've set. If you'd like to look further afield, the are.na channel
[an idea for a
website](https://www.are.na/ian-mcdonald/an-idea-for-a-website) is a
great start.

### presenting work

All classwork is presented through personal websites, that you will use
to document your progress. come to each class with the assignment
finished, on your website, and prepared to talk about it. I will
randomise you each week, and if picked you'll have a 5 min slot to talk
about your week and what you found out, and people can ask you questions
(we'll talk to \~4 people a week, more for larger projects).

There is no point in taking this class if you don't do the homework:
this is how you develop the skills you need to work on the web! Missing
one of these unannounced will bring your grade down by a half point each
time. (you can make it back up (once) if you publish within the week).

### group work

You may choose to work on any of the weekly projects in a group of not
more than two students -- and it's encouraged you try this at least once
in the semester. Do bear in mind that group projects will not just be
marked on the quality of the work (which should exceed the scope of a
solo attempt), but on how well you have worked together (to be recorded
in the git commit history).

### on the readings

Readings for this class come in two types: preparational, and
inspirational. The preparational ones will set the tone for the start of
the next class, and you should come having read and thought about them,
as we'll use them as the basis for the initial discussion. The
inspirational readings are there to provide different perspectives on
the previous class, or the assignment you're doing. They might be
particularly helpful if you find yourself getting bogged down in
something, or lacking ideas. Sometimes, readings will be websites to
click through and think about, that will introduce new ideas.

*In both cases, notes on the readings should feature in your blog posts
as you think about each week's assignment.* As we go along you might
want to swap the 'inspirational' readings with something else you find
inspiring -- that's fine, but do also write about what you read.
Readings are always 'due' the next scheduled class.

### on grades

Grades for this class are assigned accordingly:

40% homework assignments (including documentation)  
30% contributions in class (readings, critiques, questions, in class assignments etc.)  
30% final project

### on frameworks

Personally, I find that web development frameworks like React, Angular
and others take some of the joy out of programming for the net, in the
sense that they require a lot more infrastructure than just throwing
some HTML and Javascript up and seeing what sticks. They are also
extremely useful for certain tasks, and widely used in industry. We'll
go through some popular frameworks in class so you know what they are,
and where they're used.

If you'd like to use one such framework for any or all of your projects,
I am happy to talk through it with you, though I would expect you to be
reasonably self sufficient and confident with the material already being
covered. I would encourage you to try it for a homework or two before
deciding to use for final project. I am most familiar with React, but
more than happy to help you with other frameworks if you give me fair
warning.

### on computers

You can use any computer to do this class! However: you will benefit
from using the same device consistently (to maintain installed
software). If you can bring your own laptop to class, it's a good idea.
If using Hunter's computers, it'll make your life easier if you can keep
to the same operating system.

### structure of each class

This will vary, but roughly:

-   1 hour class discussion. show+critique due or in-progress
    assignments, talk about the readings, reflect on
    learnings/challenges from the past week.

-   10min break (get a snack?)

-   45min lecture

-   45min in-class exercise/activity

-   10min wrap up and discussion

-   10min homework for this week.

### on asking questions

We'll talk in class about how to ask good questions about your code.

At some point during the semester you might use a platform like [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com) to ask a question about some code
you're struggling with. Take a screenshot of the question and replies,
and write a short discussion of how you think it went: whether the
interaction was helpful, whether you had to follow up etc etc.

### attendance

The success of this class involves your presence and participation. As
such, it is important that you are here, and on time. **You will not be
penalised for one absence**, so long as you notify me in advance. Two
absences will reduce your grade one step (A -\> A-), three absences
reduce two steps. More than that will have a serious impact on your
grade.
