The layout of this site and the class structure owes much to Neil Gershenfeld's class [*How to Make Almost Anything*](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.19/).

Ideas, readings and general inspiration for the syllabus have come from a number of places, but I was particularly inspired by the approaches of Laurel Schwulst's [*Very Interactive*](http://veryinteractive.net), Melanie Hoff's [*Folder Poetry Workshop*](https://github.com/melaniehoff/folderpoetry), the Knowledge Futures Group's [*Structuring Collective Knowledge*] workshop, Everest Pipkin's [*Data Gardens*] class, the School for Poetic Computation, Shannon Mattern's wonderful syllabi.
