there's a lot of good stuff that we don't have time to touch on, but has influenced this course in some way and, given infinite time, would feel like an exciting inclusion in the reading list. None of these are compulsory, though reading them will definitely make you think in new and interesting ways about the web.

great sources of reading:
bret victor's library
