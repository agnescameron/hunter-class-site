This website is intended as a large buffet table of information: something to take from, to pick at, to share, to leave and return to at will. The layout of this site and the class structure owes much to Neil Gershenfeld's class [*How to Make Almost Anything*](http://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/863.19/), a class which encourages a very particular kind of creativity, experimentation and open-mindedness.

Ideas, readings and general inspiration for this class have come from a number of places, but I was particularly inspired by the approaches of Laurel Schwulst's [*Very Interactive*](http://veryinteractive.net), Melanie Hoff's [*Folder Poetry Workshop*](https://github.com/melaniehoff/folderpoetry), the Knowledge Futures Group's [*Structuring Collective Knowledge*](https://knowledgestructure.pubpub.org/iap19) workshop, Everest Pipkin's [*Data Gardens*](https://everestpipkin.github.io/datagardens/) class, the [School for Poetic Computation](https://sfpc.io), and Shannon Mattern's [*Data Archive Infrastructure*](http://wordsinspace.net/shannon/teaching/data-archive-infrastructure/) syllabus.

This site was made using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com), an open-source static site generator (because I wanted to try it out).
