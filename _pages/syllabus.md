## what is web3?


## class goals

* feel fluent and comfortable writing code for the web using Javascript and JQuery, and have an understanding of common web development workflows
* understand the basics of how the web is structured, and use this understanding to utilise APIs and requests
* think critically, experimentally and imaginatively about the web
* become familiar with the command line, the console, and the node framework. feel happy about writing Node shell scripts and understand how they can contribute to your workflow.
* understand how and where to include libraries and modules in your code
* through readings and thought exercises, develop and realise your own ideas about what the web should look like
* learn about simulation and modelling techniques, and how they can be used to create complex systems
* appreciate computer games as a mode of artistic enquiry

## Structure of the course:
This course is entirely project-based. this means no exams! but also this does mean that you need to put some work in. The other thing this means is that I will also verify that your work is your own. 

I will:
— look at your git commit history
— ask you about your code and how it works

This class is not about having perfect code each week, and I would not expect you to! Publish and document whatever you have as you go along, so I can see your thoughts evolving as you go. If you’re really struggling, email me before saturday night at the latest, and turn up to office hours on monday / make alternative arrangements, and we can work on getting you back on track. Don’t leave everything till the night before!

Each week, I expect a short paragraph or two on what you struggled with, what you enjoyed, your thoughts on the readings and notes for yourself. This will be really useful to you as you revisit your work, and try and remember what you did and how you did it!

it’s totally ok if things don’t work out. it’s not ok if you make no effort. git affords me a unique opportunity to distinguish between these things: be honest about what you did and what you need help with. 

want you to make this class useful to you. feel free to adapt tasks (though talk to me about it first). Tasks are deliberately open ended, but if you’re struggling for inspiration you are more than welcome to use one of the example problems that I’ve set. If you’d like to look further afield, are.na ideas for a website is a great start.

### on frameworks

personally, I find that workflows like react etc take some of the joy out of programming for the net, in the sense that they require a lot more infrastructure than just throwing some HTML and javascript up and seeing what sticks. that aside, they are also extremely useful for certain tasks, and widely used in industry. we’ll go through some popular frameworks in class so you know what they are, and where they’re used.

if you’d like to use one such framework for all or any of your projects, I will happily help you get set up during office hours though I would expect you to be reasonably self sufficient and confident with the material already being covered. try for a homework before deciding to use for final project. i am most familiar with react, and haven’t used x, y, or z, but more than happy to help you debug it if you give me fair warning.

### structure of each class:
* 1 hour what happened this week, what did everyone do and what did they think about it. Any big web news we’ll also talk about / if we have significant readings.

* 10min break (get a snack!)

* 1h lecture

* 30min exercise/activity

* 10min wrap up and discussion

* 10min homework for this week.

### on asking questions:
At some point, you’re going to get code that doesn’t work, and you really can’t figure out why. You’ve tried all the normal things. 

I don’t want to put this in a particular week (it’ll feel forced), but at some point during the semester i expect you to use either 1) stack overflow or 2) GitHub Issues to ask a question about some code you’re struggling with (instead of me…). Take a screenshot of the question and replies, and write a short discussion of how you think it went: whether the interaction was helpful, whether you had to follow up etc etc

if this doesn’t happen (e.g. if you already find answers to your questions through one of these platforms) then that’s cool: but take an answer you found helpful, and talk about the process of finding it, and how the answerer and the questioner interacted.

if you didn’t need to use stack overflow the whole time you were using this course, you might not be challenging yourself enough…

if you want to email me with a question, I expect it to be in a ‘good question’ format: 

# plagiarism:
mit code guide. write code yourselves! esp for single line programs copy paste is tempting but you learn nothing

# presenting work
each week you will update your website with documentation of progress. come to each class with the homework finished, on your website, and prepared to talk about it. I will randomise you each week, and if picked you’ll have a 5 min slot to talk about your week and what you found, and people can ask you questions (we’ll talk to 4 people a week). this will help all of you learn! (don’t think you get off if I don’t pick you — I will look at your commits)

there is no point in taking this class if you don’t do the homework: this is how you develop the skills you need to work on the web!

Missing one of these unannounced will bring your grade down by a half point each time. (you can make it back up if you publish within the week, but do that more than twice and u done bb)

# missing class

if you need to miss class for personal reasons, I will not ask you further questions about that: please just notify me via email. I will trust that it is serious, and you will not be sanctioned at all (in exchange for this trust, I do ask you to be honest with me about what constitutes ‘serious’). however, I do still expect the homework to be due, with an extension if you need one.
