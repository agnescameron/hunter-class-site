## class goals

* feel fluent and comfortable writing code for the web using Javascript and JQuery, and have an understanding of common web development workflows
* understand the basics of how the web is structured, and use this understanding to utilise APIs and requests
* think critically, experimentally and imaginatively about the web
* become familiar with the command line, the console, and the node framework. feel happy about writing Node shell scripts and understand how they can contribute to your workflow.
* understand how and where to include libraries and modules in your code
* through readings and thought exercises, develop and realise your own ideas about what the web should look like
* learn about simulation and modelling techniques, and how they can be used to create complex systems
* appreciate computer games as a mode of artistic enquiry
